## IDEAS

# Mechanics based on counting
# - Counting the number of allies
# - Counting the number of enemies
# - Counting the number of status effects
# - Counting the number of items
# - Counting the number of tiles

# Refined ideas
# - Prismatic amulet (area 3 effect):
  # - Grants "source of light" when around allies
  # - Grants "source of darkness" when around enemies
  # - Grants invisibility when completely alone
# - Ring of Heroism
  # - +1 damage for each adjacent enemy
# - Ring of Martyrdom
  # - +1 defense for each adjacent enemy
# - Ring of Prophecy
  # - +1 spell for each nearby allied caster
# - Raise Dead
 # - Consumes nearby corpses and summons an equivalent number of zombies and skeletons
# - Ring of Slimes
 # - Summons a companion slime
 # - If the owner of the ring is adjacent to two slimes, they die and merge into a bigger slime with a fixed time to live
 # - The ring comes in the following variants: fire slime (burns), pond slime (slows), vile slime (poisons)
 # - fire slime + fire slime = bomb slime (source of light, burns, explodes on death)
 # - fire slime + pond slime = mist slime (fast, flies, ethereal)
 # - fire slime + vile slime = dark slime (source of darkness, bleeds, blinds)
 # - pond slime + pond slime = snow slime (swims, slows, freezes)
 # - pond slime + vile slime = cure slime (healing spells, regenerates)
 # - vile slime + vile slime = dire slime (causes panic, hallu, rage)
